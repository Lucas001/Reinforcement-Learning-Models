# Reinforcement Learning Examples

The main goal of this project is provide an examples of Q-Value and Q-learning, which are Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

The first is done through a path planning experiment, where the robot have to reach the ball. As it is a Model-Based process, it calculates all its moves before act:

And the Q-learning algorithm learns a policy of a basic crawler:
